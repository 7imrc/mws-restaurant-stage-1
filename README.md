# Restaurant Reviews App

For this Udacity project, I had to take a static webpage and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.

In addition, a service worker was added to create an offline experience for the users.

## Getting Started

1. You will need a simple HTTP server, to serve up the files on your local computer.  Python can be used to do this, among others.

2. With the server up and running, visit the site `http:\\localhost:8000` to open up the Restaurant Review App's homepage.

3. You can then navigate the webpage, to find a choice of cuisine and areas within New York to dine.

### Prerequisites

1. Python can be used to act as the HTTP server.  If you do not have it installed already, then visit their website [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. Once the review is completed, you will need to obtain your own Google maps API key from [website](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

### Installing

1.  In a terminal, navigate to the project's folder.

2.  Then run the HTTP server.  For example using Python 3.6, you can use the command: `py -3.6 -m http.server 8000`.

If you are unsure of which version of Python you have installed already, check with the command: `python -v`.

3. In a browser, enter `http://localhost:8000`, to load the Restaurant Review app's homepage.
